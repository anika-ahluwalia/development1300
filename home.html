          <h2><span class="highlight-2">Goals and Value</span></h2>
          <p>
            In order to become more comfortable with React, I decided to create a website that would allow 
            a user to aggregate their favorite songs into a playlist. This webpage would also include functionality
            that would allow the user to filter and sort their list of songs that could be added to the playlist.
          </p>
          <p>
            The goal of this project was to gain familiarity with React and web development, while creating
            a useful application. This application draws inspiration from my favorite music streaming service,
            Spotify. While Spofity allows users to easily search through their liked songs by title or look at 
            a certain artist or genre that they like, there is no easy way to filter all of these specifications 
            at once. Personally, when I go to create a playlist in the software, I find myself endlessly scrolling
            through my list of 500+ liked songs until I stumble on the select few that fit the mood that I am
            attempting to achieve for this playlist.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus, this design attempts to remedy this issue and demonstrate a concept of streamlined browsing for 
            songs. While users retain the ability to search for their desired songs, they can filter these results
            in ways that may be helpful when creating their playlists. For example, users can filter songs based on
            mood and genre which may be helpful when creating a playlist of similar songs. They can also sort their
            songs based on the timing and rating of the song, which could streamline their browsing as well.

      <h2><span class="highlight-2">Usability Principles</span></h2>
      <p>
        When creating this application, I took a lot of inspiration from Spotify. The "dark mode" background and 
        primarily green and white color scheme was meant to mimic the look of Spotify and create an association 
        between the two. My playlist aggregator also had a similar structure to Spotify's playlist structure by 
        placing the editable title of the playlist at the top with its total time below it and having all of the 
        songs follow in a list. 
      </p>
      <p>I also chose to improve my design by incorporating the following usability principles:</p>

      <h4><span class="highlight-2">Usability</span></h4>
      <ul>Actionable components are clearly separated (button and text enter UI).</ul>
      <ul>Responsive to resizes in the screen size.</ul>

      <h4><span class="highlight-2">Memorability</span></h4>
      <ul>Action buttons have the same format everywhere.</ul>
      <ul>All cards include the same information in similar displays and have the same information hierarchy.</ul>

      <h4><span class="highlight-2">Learnability</span></h4>
      <ul>Action buttons cause immediate responses that can easily be reverted.</ul>

      <h4><span class="highlight-2">Efficiency</span></h4>
      <ul>Filtering and sorting allows users to enrich their browsing experience.</ul>

            Finally, I created the website and deployed it! I would love it if you took a quick look at the webpage 
            and my code.
